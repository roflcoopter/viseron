The Storage component manages Viserons database and how to store files.
It helps you to organize segments, recordings and snapshots across multiple storage locations.

Files can be retained based on age and/or space used so that you never run out of storage.

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>Configuration example</summary>

```yaml
storage:
  recorder:
    tiers:
      - path: /ssd/tier1
        events:
          max_age:
            days: 1
        continuous:
          max_age:
            days: 1
      - path: /hdd/tier2
        events:
          max_age:
            days: 7
  snapshots:
    tiers:
      - path: /config/tier1
        max_age:
          days: 1
```

:::tip

The above example will store recordings/events on `/ssd/tier1` for 1 day, and then move them to `/hdd/tier2` for 7 days.

It will also store continuous recordings on `/ssd/tier1` for 1 day, after which they are deleted.

:::

</details>

<ComponentConfiguration meta={ComponentMetadata} config={config} />

:::caution

Be aware that the age of a file is calculated from the time it was created, not the time it was moved to the current tier.
It is **NOT** additive. In the <code>Configuration example</code> above, a file will be completely deleted after **7 days**, not 8 days.

:::

## Tiers

Tiers is list of directories that Viseron can use to store files.

Viseron will always write to the first tier. `max_size`/`max_age` then decides when files are moved to the next tier or deleted.

**It is of utmost importance that the first tier is a local disk or a RAM disk.**<br></br>
Viseron will not be able to detect new files and will not be able to gather file metadata if the first tier is a network share/NTFS mount.

:::danger

The first tier **cannot** be a network share/NTFS mount. Viseron will not be able to detect new files and will not be able to gather file metadata.
The first tier should be a local disk or a RAM disk. The other tiers can be network shares/NTFS mounts.

:::

When the `max_size` is hit the oldest files will be moved to the next tier.<br></br>
When the age of a file exceeds the `max_age`, it will be moved to the next tier.<br></br>
If the current tier is the last one, the file is deleted instead.

:::caution

If you change a tier path, you need to manually move the files to the new path.

:::

:::info

For technical reasons it is very likely that there will be a few extra megabytes of files than the `max_size` allows, so leave some extra space on the disk.

### Continuous (24/7) recordings

To enable continuous recordings for **all** cameras you use the `continuous` configuration option for a tier.
The below example will store 10gb of continuous recordings in the default location `/segments`.
No events will be stored.

<details>
  <summary>Continuous recordings configuration example</summary>

```yaml title="/config/config.yaml"
storage:
  recordings:
    tiers:
      - path: / # Will store segments in /segments folder inside the container
        continuous:
          max_size:
            gb: 10
```

</details>

:::tip

To set camera specific options, you can use `continuous` or override the entire `storage` configuration under your camera configuration.
See the `recorder` documentation for the component that provides your cameras.

### Advanced configuration

For more advanced setups, `min_size` and `min_age` can be used.
They are best explained in a `config.yaml` example:

<details>
  <summary>Advanced configuration example</summary>

```yaml title="/config/config.yaml"
storage:
  recordings:
    tiers:
      - path: /mnt/ramdisk # Store continuous recordings and events here
        continuous:
          max_size: # If this target is hit, segments will be moved to the next tier
            gb: 1
          max_age: # If this target is hit, segments will be moved to the next tier
            days: 1
        events:
          max_size: # If this target is hit, segments will be moved to the next tier
            gb: 1
          max_age: # If this target is hit, segments will be moved to the next tier
            days: 1
      - path: /mnt/ssd # Store only events here
        events:
          min_size: # If max_age is hit, keep at least 1gb
            gb: 1
          max_size: # If this target is hit, segments will be moved to the next tier
            gb: 10
          max_age: # If this target is hit, segments will be moved to the next tier ONLY if size is larger than min_size
            days: 7
      - path: /mnt/nas # Store only events here
        events:
          min_age: # If max_size is hit, keep at least 30 days worth of recordings. DOES NOT AFFECT max_age
            days: 30
          max_size: # If this target is hit, recordings/segments will be DELETED ONLY if they are older than 30 days
            gb: 100
```

:::tip

The same strategy can be applied for snapshots (images of detected objects, faces etc)

## Database Migrations

Viseron will sometimes require database migrations to be run when you upgrade Viseron.
This is done automatically on startup, and you should **avoid** stopping Viseron while migrations are running.
