Zones are used to define areas in the cameras field of view where you want to
look for certain objects (labels).<br />
Say you have a camera facing the sidewalk and have <code>labels</code> setup to
record the label <code>person</code>.<br />
This would cause Viseron to start recording people who are walking past the
camera on the sidewalk. Not ideal.<br />
To remedy this you define a zone which covers <b>only</b> the area that you are
actually interested in, excluding the sidewalk.

<CodeBlock language="yaml" showLineNumbers>
  {`${
    props.meta && props.meta.name
      ? props.meta.name
      : "<object detector component>"
  }:
  object_detector:
    cameras:
      camera_one:
        ...
        // highlight-start
        zones:
          - name: sidewalk
            coordinates:
              - x: 522
                y: 11
              - x: 729
                y: 275
              - x: 333
                y: 603
              - x: 171
                y: 97
            labels:
              - label: person
                confidence: 0.8
                trigger_recorder: true
        // highlight-end`}
