A motion detector scans an image for moving parts.

:::info

Detected motion can, if configured, signal an object detector to start scanning.
This is good because object detection uses far more resources compared to motion detection.

:::tip Recorder

A motion detector can start the recorder if `trigger_recorder` is set to `true`, meaning an object detector is not strictly needed.<br />
