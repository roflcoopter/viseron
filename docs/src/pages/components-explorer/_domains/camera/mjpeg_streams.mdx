Viseron will serve MJPEG streams of all cameras.

### Dynamic streams

The dynamic streams are automatically created for each camera.
They utilize [query parameters](#query-parameters) to control what is displayed on the stream.

Example URL: `http://localhost:8888/<camera_identifier>/mjpeg-stream`

#### Query parameters

A number of query parameters are available to instruct Viseron to resize the stream or draw different things on the image.<br />
To utilize a parameter you append it to the URL after a `?`. To add multiple parameters you separate them with `&`, like this:<br />

```
http://localhost:8888/<camera name slug>/mjpeg-stream?<parameter1>=<value>&<parameter2>=<value>`
```

| draw_objects     | any  | If this query parameter is set to a truthy value (`true`, `1` etc), found objects will be drawn           |
| draw_motion      | any  | If this query parameter is set to a truthy value (`true`, `1` etc), detected motion will be drawn         |
| draw_motion_mask | any  | If this query parameter is set to a truthy value (`true`, `1` etc), configured motion masks will be drawn |
| draw_zones       | any  | If this query parameter is set to a truthy value (`true`, `1` etc), configured zones will be drawn        |
| mirror           | any  | If this query parameter is set to a truthy value (`true`, `1` etc), mirror the image horizontally.        |
| rotate           | any  | Degrees to rotate the image. Positive/negative values rotate clockwise/counter clockwise respectively     |

:::warning

If you are going to have more than one consumer of the stream, it is better to configure your own [static MJPEG streams](#static-streams).
This is because each dynamic stream will process their frames individually, duplicating the processing.

:::

### Static streams

The MJPEG streams work exactly as the [dynamic streams](#dynamic-streams), but instead of defining the query parameters in the URL, they are defined in the `config.yaml`<br />
The benefit of using these predefined streams instead is that frame processing happens only once.<br />
This means that you can theoretically have as many streams open as you want without increased load on your machine.

  <summary>Config example</summary>

```yaml
<component that provides camera domain>:
  camera:
    front_door:
      ...
      mjpeg_streams:
        my-big-front-door-stream:
          width: 100
          height: 100
          draw_objects: true
        my-small-front-door-stream:
          width: 100
          height: 100
          draw_objects: true
          draw_zones: true
          draw_object_mask: true
```

</details>

The config example above would give you two streams, available at these endpoints:<br />
`http://localhost:8888/front_door/mjpeg-streams/my-big-front-door-stream`<br />
`http://localhost:8888/front_door/mjpeg-streams/my-small-front-door-stream`
